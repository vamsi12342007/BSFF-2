      <h4 class="synopsisheader">Synopsis</h4>
      <p id="whatsynopsis">Bart and his group of outlaws are looking for one last score before leaving the territory.
        They have decided to hide just outside of town in a beautiful home while Bart sends one of his boys into town to
        grab the bank manager. Bart is enjoying a cigar and a drink in the home of the bank manager when Charlie comes
        back with the bank teller. Not the first time Charlie has messed up. All the other boys are upset with Charlie,
        again for messing up. Charlie decides to get him to talk by beating him up, hoping he will give up the
        information about the town’s bank that they are all looking for. As Bart is informed that Charlie is back by his
        right hand, Leroy, Bart stares at a picture of a past love he should never have left.
        As Bart leaves the home, he stops and yells at Charlie. He proceeds to apologize to the teller for the way he
        was treated but insists there was meaning behind it. They need to know where the key is to the safe in town so
        they can leave town with one last big score. They have the law just two days behind them and they are in a
        hurry. As the bank teller Tom, is questioned by Bart and asked if he is married and has children, Tom decides he
        isn’t dying for anyone. He gives up the key to the safe. It’s around his next and Bart and his boys think they
        have scored?
        Bart sends Charlie back into the house to check on the bank manager to see if he is still alive. As Charlie
        starts for the house, Tom informs Bart of a new safe that was just delivered and it needs a key and a
        combination to open it.
        Bart stops and yells at Charlie to keep the bank manager alive but as Charlie reaches the door, he hears Bart
        yell at him but as he opens the door, Charlie hears a familiar click of a shotgun. Charlie turns for cover
        against the building and two shotgun blasts just miss him. Charlie rushes in with his gun drawn and fires at the
        bank manager, killing on the floor of the house.
        Charlie proudly comes out, trying to get back on Bart’s good side. Bart yells at him that they needed the bank
        manager alive. Charlie pleads his case about being shot at.
        Bart has had enough. With an all to familiar look at Leroy, as Charlie turns to walk away, Leroy guns him down
        as he walk. Charlie falls dead to the ground.
        Leroy reminds Bart about Tom, still sitting there, tied up, sitting on a fallen tree. Bart decides he has seen
        too much and is no longer valuable and shoots him dead as well.
        Bart and his boys mount up and head into the town to see if the key fits and they can track down that
        combination somewhere for one last big score.</p>
